Find out what it thinks about your idea and if it has any data sources (URLs for specific sites) that could be helpful.  Below, either include copy/paste the chat history from your conversation or include a link to the shared chat.

It's the up-arrow icon in the upper-right corner of your chat window.)\n",

Childhood obesity is a significant public health issue, and by focusing on different characteristics like age, race, and socioeconomic status, you're adding depth to your analysis. Understanding the trends over time will help highlight how different groups may be more affected by obesity, and it could guide potential interventions. Do you plan to use statistical methods to analyze the data, or are you focusing more on descriptive trends?\n",

        "ChatGPT: That’s a great approach! The CDC is definitely one of the best sources for reliable, up-to-date data on childhood obesity. I'd recommend starting with their \"National Center for Health Statistics\" (NCHS) website. Specifically, you can find obesity statistics broken down by age, race/ethnicity, and other key factors. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is another excellent source—it has detailed health data for children and adolescents, including obesity rates and contributing factors."
